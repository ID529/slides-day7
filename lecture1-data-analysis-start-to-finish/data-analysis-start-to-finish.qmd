# Data Analysis From Start to Finish {.white-title .white-code background-image="images/bg-no-planet.png" background-size="110% auto"}

## Context for what we'll be discussing 

<br> 

-   To walk through the methods implemented with R to go from raw data to data analysis for an exposure assessment project for "EH 263 Analytical Methods and Exposure Assessment". 

<br> 

-   The project aimed to explore the additional contribution of food truck exhaust to Ultra-fine Particle Concentrations in ambient air, above and beyond background levels.

## Methods implemented that we have discussed 

  -   Project based workflows
  -   Reading in data with `readr`
  -   Conditionals and for loops
  -   Writing functions
  -   Data manipulation using `dplyr`
  -   Combining (linking) datasets
  -   Text processing using `stringr`
  -   Working with factors, dates, and times using `lubridate`
  -   Data visualizations using `ggplot`
  -   Functional programming for efficient file imports and modeling

## Why food trucks? 

-   UFPs have an aerodynamic diameter of 0.1 µm or less (Li et al., 2016; Moreno-Ríos et al., 2022)

<br>

-   Diesel exhaust substantially contributes to UFP concentrations 

<br>

-   Food trucks often use diesel or gas generators to power truck operations
    -   These generators are typically run for many hours (i.e., for the duration of time trucks are on-site)

## Existing regulations

<br>

-   To improve the ambient air quality of air pollutants from idling vehicles, the Massachusetts Anti-Idling Law limits engine idling up to 5 minutes (MA Department of Environmental Protection, n.d.).
    -   However, there are no restrictions in the Mass. Anti-Idling Law, or other laws, that aim to constrain air-pollution emissions from food truck generators)

## Hypotheses

<br>

1. UFP concentrations will be higher when food trucks are present compared with when they are not present

<br>

2. UFP measurements at a 5-meter distance from food trucks will be associated with higher UFP concentrations when compared with measurements taken at a 10-meter distance

## Study design overview {.smaller}

![](images/ft-study-design.png){width=50%}
</center>

**Figure A:** Sampling site configuration at the HSCP. Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) placement in relation to the HSCP outdoor dining area and food truck parking area is shown in red. 

**Figure B:** Approximate timeline for the sampling protocol. Data collection began at approximately 10:00 AM and ended at approximately 11:30 AM. Food truck arrival times varied, but generally occurred between 10:15 and 11:00 AM.

# Data processing problems to solve {.white-title .white-code background-image="images/bg-no-planet.png" background-size="110% auto"}


## Part 1: Compiling and organizing UFP data {.smaller}

<br>

-   **Compile 34 raw data files** that were exported from CPC device software

<br>

-   **For each file (Part A):**
    -   Standardize the file structure
    -   Derive new variables based on existing columns, and metadata embedded in file names
        -   A sample ID variable
        -   File name
        -   Several date/time variables
        -   An indicator for which CPC device collected the measurements
        -   An indicator for which distance the measurements were collected at (5- versus 10-meter)
    -   Re-organize the columns

##  CPC raw data example file (n=34, each with 5000+ rows)

![](images/ft-cpc-ufp-raw-example.png)

## Part 1: Compiling and organizing UFP data (cont.) {.smaller}

<br>

-   **For each file (Part B):**
    -   Reference a sample log to "look up" truck arrival times for a given sample ID (e.g., FT001, FT002, etc.)
    -   Use this truck arrival time to create an indicator for whether a one-second measurement was taken before or after truck arrival (i.e., Pre-truck versus Post-truck)
        -   **Note:** This is because the CPCs were continuously collecting measurements for the whole measurement period (all pre- and post-truck arrival measurements were contained within a single file) 


## Sample log example file (n=1)

![](images/ft-sample-log.png)


## Part 2: Joining measurement and sample log data with covariate data
<br> 

-   The Pre- versus Post-truck indicator in Part 1 allows us to join data from a third file containing covariate data

:::{.small-break}
:::

-   The covariate data file contained:
    -   Sample ID
    -   A pre- versus post-truck indicator variable
    -   Meteorological parameters (e.g., temperature (F), % relative humidity, wind speed (mph), etc.
