"The things we consider important are often undervalued by other disciplines … One of the most important concepts in Statistics is that of missing data. For most people it’s easy to ignore because much of it is not very visible." <br>
— Cyntha Struthers and Don McLeish <br><br>

"We can’t just learn what we want to know, but what we should know." <br>— Biden <br><br>

"There are no routine statistical questions; only questionable statistical routines."<br>
— D.R. Cox <br><br>

## reasons you might have missing data {background-color="#BBD8FF"}

  * the machine was broken
  * the participant didn't want to give an answer
  * the participant was late to their interview 
  * lost/corrupted data files
  * outlier data coded to missing
  * suppressed/confidential/censored data
  
\* not meant to be exhaustive

## how to think about missing data {background-color="#ffeaa7"}

  * is the missingness random, not conditional on anything? like a coin-toss?
  <span class='carrot'>(**MCAR**: missing completely at random)</span>
  * is the missingness random, conditional on variables you've observed?
  <span class='carrot'>(**MAR**: missing at random)</span>
  * is the missingness determined or conditional on variables you **haven't**
  observed? <span class='carrot'>(**MNAR**: missing not at random)</span>

  1. report on the missingness! 
  2. look for trends in the missingness, and report on those trends.
  3. (if you perform imputation) make sure your imputation model matches your
  regression model.
